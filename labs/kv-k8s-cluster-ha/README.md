#### Kuberverse HA Cluster

This is the **full lab** created for those who wants to install a k8s cluster using the kubeadm method but wish to optimize even more the time. This template installs and bootstraps automatically a full cluster with the **calico** networking interface. This is the full cluster build that I have created to optimize your study time.

### Latest Changes ###

28/10/2021 - This lab was updated to run the latest version of Kubernetes 1.22.3. The cluster runs over Ubuntu 18.04.6 and the container runtime Docker 18.9.1. All links and references where updated to reflect the actual changes.

##### Use it if: #####
